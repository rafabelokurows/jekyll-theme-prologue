<p>I'm Rafael Belokurows, a Brazilian living in Porto - Portugal in love with the city and even more in love with the most amazing girl I could possibly hope to find â™¥.
   Since the beginning of my course, in 2019,  I have been focusing almost exclusively on my studies while also developing my skills in SQL, Python/R programming and statistics and working with exciting and meaningful side projects in the fields of Natural Language Processing, Data Visualization and Predictive analytics.
  I worked in IT all my life and I'm looking to start an amazing career in Data Analysis/Data Science. I know SQL, R and a bit of Python and I have worked with some of the main visualization tools in the market.</p>
