This website was built using a customized and enhanced Jekyll theme. For some examples or tips on how to do it yourself, check the theme's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue). Thanks, Chris Bobbe!

<!---All sections have titles, which are listed in the site's navigation menu. At the top of each section, the section's title will render by default (e.g., Welcome to Jekyll!). If you want it to show something different (see Intro), add **auto-header: none** to your frontmatter, and add your text in a <h2> tag inside a <header> tag outside the frontmatter. You'll want to give each section an **order** parameter, also in the frontmatter, or it won't know where to put itself and will hide. Icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons).
